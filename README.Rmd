<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of endeavr is to calculate MVN density for an observed data matrix with
given mean vector and covariance matrix

## Installation

You can install the development version of endeavr from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("annesh07/endeavr")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(endeavr)
mvnpdf(X = matrix(rep(1,6), 2, 3),
                  mean = c(1,2,3),
                  varcovM = diag(2),
                  Log = TRUE)
```
